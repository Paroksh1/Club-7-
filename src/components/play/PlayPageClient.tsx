/**
 * Sport selection is derived directly from the `?sport=` URL param on
 * every render rather than mirrored into local state — the earlier
 * version seeded a `useState` from the URL once on mount, which meant
 * browser back/forward (which Next.js surfaces as new `searchParams`
 * without remounting this component) never updated the visible sport,
 * even though the URL itself was changing correctly. Deriving directly
 * makes the URL the single source of truth, so there's nothing to fall
 * out of sync. `router.push` (not `replace`) so each sport switch is
 * its own history entry — otherwise there'd be nothing for back/
 * forward to actually navigate through.
