/**
 * PHOTOGRAPHY STATUS — read before adding new sections.
 *
 * The project's whole image library is 8 files. Only three show
 * people at all (last-goal-night.jpg, warmup-turf.jpg — both stock,
 * not Club 7's own footage — and cafe-porch.jpg, which is a
 * residential-porch photo, not Club 7's venue). None show a group
 * arriving together, celebrating a birthday, or organising an event —
 * the exact moments this page most wants to show. Every slot below
 * reuses one of these honestly, with a different crop per use, rather
 * than inventing a "Club 7" photo that doesn't exist. A short, real
 * event-specific shoot (people arriving as a group, a birthday
 * celebration, a private group together) is the single highest-
 * leverage asset this page is missing — flagged wherever it's used,
 * not hidden.
