/**
 * Every fact in `info` below already exists elsewhere on the site
 * (Hero, GroundSection). Pickleball genuinely only has one confirmed
 * detail beyond location; it stays at two info points rather than
 * padding to three.
 *
 * PHOTOGRAPHY — verified status of each image, and what's still missing:
 * - Football: representative stock (`stock: true`), not Club 7's own
 *   footage — disclosed honestly in the alt text rather than
 *   attributed to the venue. Cropped tighter and shifted toward the
 *   player/referee cluster to reduce how much of the frame the goal
 *   net's foreground rope dominates; the rope crosses most of the
 *   photo at some density, so no crop removes it entirely.
 * - Cricket: real Club 7 photography, but an empty top-down shot of
 *   the turf — no player action exists in the library. Kept because
 *   it's genuine and unambiguous (the red pitch marking identifies the
 *   sport clearly), not because it satisfies "recognisable action."
 *   Real cricket action photography is a real gap.
 * - Pickleball: real Club 7 photography, shot in daylight. Previously
 *   graded with a heavy "day-for-night" filter + dark overlay to fake
 *   a night mood — dropped that entirely here in favour of a light,
 *   natural grade, since the photo is honestly daytime and forcing it
 *   into a false night register was exactly the "synthetic-looking"
 *   treatment to avoid. No players are in this photo either; real
 *   pickleball action photography is also a gap.
